# UGS_FYP_SamSea
This is the final submission of my Honours Year Project at University of Glasgow(Singapore): [HN-D187] E-Commerce Platform Development: Ecommerce Analytics System

Created concepts for Real-Time Dashboards (HTML5, Bootstrap 3, Javascript, jQuery) and a Product Recommendation Engine (Python) using Locality Sensitivity Hashing (LSH).

'Dashboards' folder contains all the HTML, JavaScript and CSS files for the Customer, Merchant and Admin View.

'Recommendation_Engine' folder includes:
- Two data sources used for this program
- Two versions of the recommender is in this folder for your preference of running the python script on a CLI or the interactive python notebook.

The findings of this project are in Dissertation.pdf
